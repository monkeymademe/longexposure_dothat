# Long Exposure Using dothat

Short note on what this is... Working on making a menu system for the Display-o-Tron Hat and Raspberry Pi Camera so you can configure making long exposures!

Current status is that the menu works and it takes a picture using those settings (not the cleanest code but it works)

## Instructions

Left Right - adjusted shutter speed (limit is 6 seconds)
Center - confirms setting on the display
Up Down - changes the incrementing number on the file name (manual for now) 
Cancel (or the 3 arrows pointing left) - Take the shot

## Issues

*Code is mince
*Needs a Real Menu

## Next Features

*Build a real menu for making all the settings happen
*Auto connect to a device (phone) for network control
*Take a normal preview
*Some how deliver pictures to a medium where the user can see it (including test shot)
*Auto increment file names even after reboot
*Time lapse feature - MUCH LATER!increment
